# OLCTemplate

My template for creating simple projects using a modified version of the [OneLoneCoder Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).

[This repo](https://github.com/Shlayne/OLCTemplate) (so I can click this link in visual studio and have it open in chrome without having to navigate there myself).
